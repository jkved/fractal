# Fractals and spatiality

This repository is dedicated for my current study and research into fractals and their geometry.

Currently the repository contains **fractal.py** file which has two classes for different fractals - Mandelbrot and NewtonRhapson. Jupyter notebook file contains a little test on them.

This repository will be updated with fractal dimension calculator and its application on spin-models.

I have previously uploaded some code on the spatiality in spin-like models. See https://github.com/jkved/spin-models for more information!
